### Inkscape extension

You must [download Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.0.2/) and move these files to `inkscape/extensions` under `%AppData%`. The path to this folder must be changed in `pixelanimation.py`. You should then find the tool under `Extensions > Pixel Animation Editor`.
